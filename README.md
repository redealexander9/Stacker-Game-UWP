# Stacker
## A simple, fun stacking game built with Universal Windows Platform
I built this game based on the classic arcade game *Stacker*. 
The goal is to stack blocks all the way to the top. The blocks move back and forth, and you press the space bar to stop them at the right time. 
I implemented a custom animation system that controls block movement, frame updates, user input, and timing. 
This game does not rely on built-in animation tools like Storyboard or Composition; instead, it uses a canvas that I 
manipulate by drawing each frame manually.
